# Moving Symbols

*Author: Ryan Szeto*

Moving Symbols is a Python package that lets you generate videos of moving images in an extremely
flexible manner. You can specify your own parameters for the translation, rotation, and scaling
speeds of images, and even use your own image datasets!

## Citing this work

If you find this dataset useful, please cite our ICLR 2018 Workshop paper:

```
@inproceedings{szeto2018dataset,

    title = "A Dataset To Evaluate The Representations Learned By Video Prediction Models",
    booktitle = "International Conference on Learning Representations (Workshop Track)",

```

## Environment

This code was tested on Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 16.04. It might not work for Python 3.X; support might
be added in the future, or perhaps someone can make a pull request to make it support both 2.X and
3.X... :)

## Dependencies

* PIL >= 5.0.0
* pygame >= 1.9.3
* pymunk >= 5.3.2
* numpy >= 1.14.0
* opencv-python >= 3.4.0.12
* scipy >= 1.0.0

The packages listed above need to be installed. This can be done via `pip`.

**One important note:** There is a visualization script, `view_moving_symbols.py`, that seems to
fail when using the `pip` version of `opencv-python`. If you really want to run that script, I
recommend installing OpenCV from source instead of through `pip`.

## How To Use (ICLR 2018 Workshop Submission)

This section describes how to generate the datasets used in our ICLR 2018 Workshop submission.

### Generate the images

Run our scripts to automatically download and organize object images in the format Moving Symbols
expects.

```bash
cd "data folder inside working directory route" (eg. cd /netscratch/arenas/dataset/moving_symbols/data)
./generate_mnist_images.sh
./generate_icons8_images.sh
# The line below prints a lot of messages about skipping images. This is normal.
./generate_omniglot_images.sh
```

### Generate the videos

To generate the actual videos, run the `generate_MovingSymbols.py` script.

## How To Use (external projects)

The core Moving Symbols code is contained in a friendly Python package. That means as long as this
project directory is in your PYTHONPATH, you can import the required classes.

Including the project directory in your PYTHONPATH can be done in one of two ways. First, you can
modify the environment variable in the terminal:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/project/root:$PYTHONPATH
```

Or you can augment the system path in your Python script directly:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/project/root')
from moving_symbols import MovingSymbolsEnvironment
```

You can find the API documentation [here](http://ryanszeto.com/moving-symbols/doc/html/index.html).
For a full example, you can look through the `iclr2018_workshop/generate_moving_symbols.py` script.
